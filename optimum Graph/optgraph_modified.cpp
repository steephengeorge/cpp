/*
This program is very simple. It contains two classes: Block and Graph.
- Graphs are responsible for ownership of a collection of Blocks.
- Blocks have two pieces of data: A name (std::string) and collection of (std::string) attributes.

This Graph class supports two operations:
1. Add a Block to the Graph (AddBlock)
  - When a Block is added to a Graph, it cannot share a name with any Blocks already in the Graph. If the Blockâ€™s name is
    already elsewhere in the graph, its name will be modified to be unique.
  - Calling AddBlock is resource acquisition. When it comes to data management, the Graph is the owner of the Block from
    this point on.
2. Return a collection of every Block in the Graph that has a specified attribute (GetBlocksWithAttribute)
  - Blocks can have any number of attributes.

There are functions below prefixed with Measure_. These _Measure functions exercise the two Graph operations previously
discussed. The goal of this exercise is to optimize the execution time of these functions:
- Measure_AddBlocks
- Measure_FindBlocksByAttribute

If you take a look at main() below, you'll see that it sends the execution time of these functions to stdout. Go ahead and 
run the program as-is and it's obvious that the initial performance of these operations is very bad.

Goal: Let's see how much better you can make it!

Here are the rules:
- The dynamic behavior of the code cannot change. Don't just write code to generate the expected output, expect your solution
  to be tested on different datasets.
- You ARE NOT allowed to modify the Measure_ functions or main().
- You ARE allowed to modify the Block and Graph classes. Feel free to change the API, data structures, etc. as long as you can
  do so without requiring a modification of Measure_ functions or main().
- Feel free to use C++11 language features or any boost classes.

When you're done, please send me three things:
- Your modified optgraph.cpp file. Please add a comment tagging where you've made changes.
- A copy/paste of the program output before and after you made your changes.
- A brief description of the changes that you made.

Bonus exercise:
Are there any problems that you see with this code that aren't related to performance optimization? Any obvious improvements
that jump out to you? Feel free to fix those issues as well, and be sure to include descriptions of what you fixed and why.

Good luck, and feel free to get in touch if you have any specific questions.
